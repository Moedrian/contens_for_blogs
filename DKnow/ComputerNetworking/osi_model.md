### 1. Physical Layer

#### 1.1 Role

> Actual physical connection between the devices. When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into bits then send them to Data Link Layer.

#### 1.2 The form of information

What is transmitted in this layer is **bit**, i.e.

#### 1.3 The functions of Physical Layer

| Function | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Bit Synchronization | Bit level synchronization between  sender and receiver via a clock. |
| Bit Rate Control | Transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent/received per second. |
| Physical Topologies | The way in which the different devices/nodes arranged in a network, i.e. bus, star or mesh topology. |
| Transmission Mode | The way in which data flows between the two connected devices. Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex |

#### 1.4 Examples
Hub, Repeater, Modem, Cables are all in the Physical layer. Check those jargons [here](../Jargon/osi_jargon.md).

### 2. Data Link Layer

#### 2.1 Role

> The data link layer provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes.

> It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. 
> It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices.
> It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.

And it has two sublayers:

* Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
  > responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data
* Logical Link Control (LLC) layer
  > responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization

#### 2.2 The form of information

Frames.

> In the OSI model of computer networking, a frame is the protocol data unit at the data link layer. Frames are the result of the final layer of encapsulation before the data is transmitted over the physical layer.

> A frame is "the unit of transmission in a link layer protocol, and consists of a link layer header followed by a packet." Each frame is separated from the next by an interframe gap.

> A frame is a series of bits generally composed of frame synchronization bits, the packet payload, and a frame check sequence.

#### 2.3 The functions of Data Link Layer

| Function | Explanation |
|:---|:---|
| Framing | It provides a way for sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. It is implemented by special bit patterns in the beginning and the end of the frame. |
| Physical Addressing | DLL adds MAC addresses of sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame. |
| Error Control | DLL detects and retransmit damaged or lost frames using mechanism built inside the layer. |
| Flow Control | The data rate *must* be constant between sender and receiver. Flow control coordinates the amount of data on both two sides. |
| Access Control | Suppose there's a single channel shared by multi devices, the MAC sublayer helps determine which device has control over the single channel at a given time. |

#### 2.4 Examples

Switches, Bridges
